# Swiss Army Knife

![](docs/images/swiss-army-knife.jpeg)

## Overview

**Swiss Army Knife** is a set of commonly used templates and automation to jump-start new projects. The goal of this repo is to add some amount of quality control prior to writing code, with as little effort as possible.

## Usage

### Option 1: Most or All

This repository is designed to be used as a submodule or cloned directly into the root of your new project.

```bash
# clone or submodule this repo into the root of your new project

cd swiss-army-knife

make help       # To see all the various components

make install    # Installs everything
```

### Option 2: Cherry Pick

To cherry-pick examples from this repo, check out the [/docs](/docs/) section for all the different components. Some components have multiple files (e.g., workflows with config files), so double-check the project tree to ensure you get everything.

## FAQ

### Why not simply use a GitHub Template Repository?

The hope is that this repo ultimately fixes two main problems with template repos:

1. Retrofitting existing repos
2. Propagating changes and updates

It is not impossible to do these things, but the process is generally manual.
