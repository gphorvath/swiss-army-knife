# Project Management

## Issue Templates

To ensure consistency and clarity when creating new issues, you can use issue templates. These templates help guide contributors to provide the necessary information, making it easier to triage and address issues.

Examples you can use in your project are provided here:

```bash
.  
└── .github  
    └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE
        ├── bug_report.md
        ├── chore.md
        └── feature_request.md
```

## Pull Request Template

To standardize and streamline the pull request process, you can create a pull request template. This template will automatically populate the description field when a new pull request is created, ensuring that all necessary information is provided.

An example you can use for your project is provided here:

```bash
.  
└── .github  
    └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
        └── pull_request_template.yaml
```
